Intro
This is a Haskell version genetic algorithm for searching global optimal solution.

Instructions
1. Make sure all the imported libraries are installed. 
    We imported Data.List, Data.Ord and System.Random

2. The inputData function will generate a list of pairs of weight and fitness data.
    The baseCase function will generate the base case population
    The runGA function is the main function of the genetic algorithm

3. Run the test cases included in the code.
